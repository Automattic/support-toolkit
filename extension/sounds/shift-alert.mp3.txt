# shift-alert.mp3

This file should be an MP3 audio file that plays when shift notifications appear.

**File**: shift-alert.mp3
**Location**: /Users/mauropereira/Desktop/app/sounds/
**Purpose**: Plays when shift starts or ends (configurable in Settings)
**Volume**: 0.4 (40%)
**Trigger**: Shift start/end notifications (if "Play reminder sound" is enabled in Settings)

**Usage in code**: notifications.js line 15
```javascript
const audioURL = chrome.runtime.getURL('sounds/shift-alert.mp3');
const audioEl = new Audio(audioURL);
audioEl.volume = 0.4;
audioEl.play();
```

**Note**: If this file is missing, the extension will continue to work, but no sound will play for shift notifications. A warning will appear in the console if the sound cannot be played.
